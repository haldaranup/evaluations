# Masai School coding evaluations
Masai School coding evaluation. Every week or every alternate week we have to give our coding evaluation and for that we have to submit our GitHub link.

Diveded every unit evaluation into their specific folder which helps to manage code better. In every folder there are subfolders for every sprint evaluation submitting code from here makes very easy for me.
